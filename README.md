# Bitasmbl-CineStream-Movie-Discovery-Interface

A visually engaging, fully responsive movie discovery interface where users can browse, filter, and favorite movies. Built entirely with React, it emphasizes an interactive UI with smooth animations, reusable components, and responsive grid layouts.

## Tech Stack

- React

## Requirements

- Use a front-end framework (React, Vue, Svelte, etc.)
- Implement at least one animation or transition using CSS or Framer Motion
- Ensure responsive design and grid layout

## Installation

bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Bitasmbl-CineStream-Movie-Discovery-Interface.git
cd Bitasmbl-CineStream-Movie-Discovery-Interface
npm install


No additional environment variables are required for this project.

## Usage

## Implementation Steps

1. Initialize the React project using Create React App.
2. Organize the folder structure with `src/components`, `src/styles`, and `public/assets`.
3. Create a responsive grid layout using CSS Grid and Flexbox to display movie cards.
4. Build reusable components: `MovieCard`, `FilterBar`, and `FavoritesList`.
5. Load movie data (mocked or from a JSON file) and manage state with React Hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`).
6. Implement filtering logic to allow users to filter movies by genre, rating, or year.
7. Add a favorites feature using `localStorage` to persist user selections across sessions.
8. Integrate animations and transitions (hover effects, fade-ins) using CSS transitions or Framer Motion.
9. Apply media queries and flexible layouts to ensure a seamless experience on mobile, tablet, and desktop.
10. Test the interface across modern browsers and various screen sizes.
